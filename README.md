# Manfred Awesomic CV

The MAC (or Manfred Awesomic CV) is a(nother) naive attempt to create **a standard open source format to define and share CVs**. The format is defined as a JSON Schema to validate CVs stored as JSON files.

## ü•ò Why using it

There are A LOT of CV formats, and some of them are a nice try to define a universal CV format, but we think that **a CV should include not only what candidates are or know, but also what they are interested in and what they want to become**.

Like most open-source projects, the first use case was found in the company where the first contributors worked. Manfred is committed to the idea that **every person should keep control over their personal and professional data**. This means that they should be able to export their data from any platform in a machine-readable format with **a Model Definition to process that data efficiently**. This is how the MAC was born.

## üñ±Ô∏è How to use it

You just need to copy, download or reference [the schema](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/schema/schema.json) to validate a new CV, built as a JSON file from scratch, or a JSON generated previously (for example, [this sample](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/samples/deafult_sample.json)).

To get started, you can copy both schema and sample in an **online validator** like [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) or [liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator).

!["JSON Schema"](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/assets/readme/MAC_online_validator_example.png?raw=true "JSON Schema")

You also have implementations to validate a JSON file programmatically in almost every coding language:

* [AVJ (JavaScript)](https://ajv.js.org/)
* [Snow (Java)](https://github.com/ssilverman/snowy-json)
* [jschon (Python)](https://jschon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* ... and [many more](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html)

> :warning: **The current MAC Schema has been designed using the 2019-09 Specification Draft**: when choosing a validator, please, check if it's compliant with the 2019-09 Draft. You can get much more information about the JSON Schema Specification in [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).

You can check **examples of how to use code to create and validate MAC files** in the [MAC/scripts](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/tree/master/scripts) directory.

The Schema is documented by itself, but it's much easier to get "the big picture" with [a graphical representation].(https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/assets/readme/MAC_diagram.png)

## üé® Who uses it

A bunch of Tech Startups, IT Consulting Companies and Recruiting Platforms already use the MAC as an interchangeable format **to unlock the data of their users, candidates and employees and give them back the power to use it wherever they want**.

## ü§ì About us

The MAC was made with ‚ù§Ô∏è and sentidi√±o in Galicia, Spain.

As common in new projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project, establishes its vision, and controls permissions to merge code into it. **We have appointed a starting Council to manage the MAC**, formed by 2 people from Manfred and 2 independent members, but the plan is to hold formal elections, where contributors will vote for candidates for the Council as soon as the project gets a minimum maturity and adoption.

Right now the Council is formed by:
